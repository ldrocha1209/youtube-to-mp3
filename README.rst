# YT2MP3 – YouTube to MP3 Desktop Downloader

**YT2MP3** is a fast, secure, and user-friendly desktop app that converts YouTube videos to high-quality MP3 audio files — directly on your Mac.

Built with [PySide6](https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python) and packaged using [BeeWare Briefcase](https://beeware.org), YT2MP3 runs natively on your computer for maximum speed and safety.

## Download

[Download the latest version (Mac only)](https://github.com/ldrocha1209/YoutubeToMp3/releases/tag/v1.0.0)
Simply unzip the app, drag it to your `Applications` folder, and launch it. If macOS warns you about it being unsigned, right-click the app and select **Open** (this only needs to be done once).

- Inject ads and trackers
- Require shady browser permissions

**YT2MP3 runs 100% locally**, ensuring:
- Better security
- Faster performance
- Full audio quality
- No reliance on sketchy servers
